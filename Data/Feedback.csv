Some of the teacher are un experienced. Also they are unfair and baised. Infact many of the teachers are having few or no experience about the subject

LESS TIME FOR STUDY
knowledge is maximum gained by reading books also the teachers explain depth if we are interested to know about it.
HAVE TO IMPROVE
every one can tell depth of course but some one only give notes
we are getting maximum knowledge
Knowledge is maximum gainedby reading books and also teachers explain the concept in depth.
Its fine but it should focus more towards practical knowledge rather than content based. It would be helpful for us.
"LESS TIME FOR PAPER ATTEMTING,LESS KNOWLEDGE."
LESS DEPTH OF COURSE BUT PROPER COURSE MATERIAL ACCORDING TO EXAM
Good
Not so good
strict paper correction.
